## 📅 Weekly Progress
- [Week 1 – Basic API (HTTP, JSON, Postman)](./week1_reqres) ✅ → Basic API (HTTP, JSON, Postman) 
- [Week 2 – Basic API + dummy API practice](./week2_jsonplaceholder/) ✅ → Basic API + dummy API practice
- Week 3 – Automation tools (Selenium/RestAssured) (coming soon)

- Use Postman to create collections and assertions.
- Perform data-driven testing using CSV or JSON files.
- Validate API response schemas.
- Run automated tests using Newman (CLI).
- Generate JSON/HTML test reports.
- Integrate automated tests with GitHub Actions (CI/CD).

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations
- The ReqRes API sometimes returns 429 Too Many Requests when called from a GitHub Actions runner (because the public IP is rate-limited).

---

## 📌 Tools
- **Postman** (API Platform)  
- **Excel** (Dataset)  
- **GitHub** (Version Control & Portfolio Hosting)
